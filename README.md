This aviation project analyzes the extent take-off weight affects fuel costs. The full report can be found in the file "Analyzing the Impact of Take-Off Weight on Fuel Costs: A Case Study".

The script for the calculations and graphs are in Flight Data.ipynb.

The script wasn't uploaded to GitHub until its final draft, hence there's few commits.
